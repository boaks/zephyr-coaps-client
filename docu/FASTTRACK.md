# Fast Track

It's not recommended, but you may start with using the [pre-build firmware images](../prebuild/). 

## Install 

Download the [nRF Connect for Desktop](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-desktop) and start it. You will need the `Programmer` App. If not already installed, please install it using the button in the nRF Connect for Desktop application.

Download one of the [pre-build firmware images](../prebuild/) matching your device and available tools.

Connect the `Thingy:91` to your debug probe and use the [nRF Connect Programmer](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=/struct_nrftools/struct/nrftools_nrfconnect.html) to apply the downloaded pre-build firmware.

## Run It

Go back to [README](../README.md#run-it).
