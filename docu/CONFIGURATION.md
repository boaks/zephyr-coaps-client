## Zephyr - Coaps Demo Client with TinyDtls

# Configuration

The demo client comes with some configuration values, which are setup using:

```
west build -b thingy91_nrf9160_ns -t menuconfig
```

for the console variant, and

```
west build -b thingy91_nrf9160_ns -t guiconfig
```

for the GUI variant. That enables to select individual features.

Alternatively you may use the project's configuration file [prj.conf](../prj.conf) to setup these features. If you want/need to uses several configuration variants, "overlays" work best. Such an overlay overwrittes the values of the standard project configuration. e.g.

[10min-prj.conf](../10min-prj.conf) prepares to send a message every 10 minutes. Enables to use a environment history to store sensor data.

For more information, see [overlays](#overlays).

## Basic

- **COAP_SERVER_HOSTNAME**, hostname of the coap/dtls 1.2 cid server. Default is the Californium's sandbox at `californium.eclipseprojects.io`.

- **COAP_SERVER_ADDRESS_STATIC**, static ip-address of the coap/dtls 1.2 cid server. Fallback, if DNS isn't setup.

- **COAP_SERVER_PORT**, static ip-address of the coap/dtls 1.2 cid server. Fallback, if DNS isn't setup. Default `5684`.

- **DTLS_PSK_IDENTITY**, the PSK identiy. Default `cali.${imei}`, e.g. "cali.352656100985434".

- **DTLS_PSK_SECRET**, the PSK secret (ASCII). Default `.fornium`. The sandbox uses this secret for the a wildcard identity "cali.*". This is only intended to easy access the sandbox, don't use it on your own test setup.

- **COAP_SEND_INTERVAL**, coap send interval in seconds. Used, if messages are send frequently. Default 0s, disabled.

- **COAP_WAKEUP_SEND_INTERVAL**, coap wakeup send interval in seconds. Used, if messages are send piggybacked with PSM wakeups. Default 0s, disabled.

- **COAP_WAIT_ON_POWERMANAGER**, coap waits for the power-manager to start exchanging application data. Takes up to 30 s and delays the first exchange. Default disabled.

- **COAP_SEND_SIM_INFO**, include information from the SIM-card. e.g. `ICCID: 89882280666025467840` and `IMSI: 901405102546784`.

- **COAP_SEND_NETWORK_INFO**, include network information. e.g.

```
!Network: CAT-M1,roaming,Band 3,PLMN 26201,TAC 67B9,Cell 01CC2B06,RSRP -105 dBm
PDN: ???,??.???.??.??
!PSM: TAU 86400 [s], Act 8 [s], Released: 10874 ms
Stat: tx 493kB, rx 67kB, max 532B, avg 289B, searchs 44, PSM delays 0
```

- **COAP_NO_RESPONSE_ENABLE**, send one-way coap message (request without response).

- **COAP_RESOURCE**, resource name of request. Default "echo".

## URI query parameter

Configure used URI query parameter. Please note, that these query parameter must be supported by the server's resource implementation. 

- **COAP_QUERY_DELAY_ENABLE**, request the server to respond delayed (use URI query parameter "delay=%d"). Only for NAT testing. Must also be enabled on server side.

- **COAP_QUERY_RESPONSE_LENGTH**, request the server to respond with a specific payload length (use URI query parameter "rlen=%d"). Large values may require blockwise transfer, which is not supported.

- **COAP_QUERY_KEEP_ENABLE**, request the server to keep the request (use URI query parameter "keep).

- **COAP_QUERY_ACK_ENABLE**, request the server to use a separate empty ACK (use URI query parameter "ack).

- **COAP_QUERY_SERIES_ENABLE**, request the server to append some of the data to a "series" (use URI query parameter "series). Currently only supported for text-payload. Lines starting with "!" are appended to the resource "series".

- **COAP_QUERY_READ_SUBRESOURCE_ENABLE**, request the server to read a sub-resource (use URI query parameter "read").

- **COAP_QUERY_READ_SUBRESOURCE**, name of the sub-resource. Default "config".

- **COAP_QUERY_WRITE_SUBRESOURCE_ENABLE**, request the server to write to a sub-resource (use URI query parameter "write").

- **COAP_QUERY_WRITE_SUBRESOURCE**, name of the sub-resource. Default "${now}".

## Extensions

### Modem

- **LTE_LOCK_PLMN_CONFIG_SWITCH**, use switch1 and switch2 of the nRf9160-DK to select the PLMN on start. on := GND, off := n.c.

- **LTE_LOCK_PLMN_CONFIG_SWITCH_STRING_1**, PLMN for switch1 on and switch2 off.

- **LTE_LOCK_PLMN_CONFIG_SWITCH_STRING_2**, PLMN for switch1 off and switch2 on.

- **LTE_LOCK_PLMN_CONFIG_SWITCH_STRING_3**, PLMN for switch1 on and switch2 on.

- **LTE_POWER_ON_OFF_ENABLE**, switch the modem on/off (AT+CFUN=0,AT+CFUN=x), when not in use. 

- **LTE_POWER_ON_OFF_CONFIG_SWITCH**, use switch1 to select PSM or modem on/off.

- **UDP_PSM_ENABLE**, enable PSM.

- **UDP_RAI_ENABLE**, enable RAI (control plane).

- **UDP_AS_RAI_ENABLE**, enable RAI (access stratum), requires 3GPP release 14 supported by the Mobile Network Operator.

- **UDP_EDRX_ENABLE**, enable eDRX.

- **MODEM_SAVE_CONFIG_THRESHOLD**, threshold to save the modem configuration. The modem is switched off and on to save the configuration.

- **MODEM_SEARCH_TIMEOUT**, modem network search timeout.

### Power Saving

- **SUSPEND_3V3**, suspend the 3.3V supply, when sleeping.

- **SUSPEND_UART**, suspend the UART, when sleeping.

### GPS/GNSS (experimental)

- **LOCATION_ENABLE**, enable the GPS/GNSS support. Still experimental. Requires a lot of work. Default disabled.

- **LOCATION_ENABLE_CONTINUES_MODE**, enable to continously receive GPS/GNSS signals. With that the Thingy:91 receives the best positions but also requires the most energy (50mA). Default enabled.

- **LOCATION_ENABLE_TRIGGER_MESSAGE**, send a message, when a position is reported by GPS/GNSS. The not continues mode is still experimental. It the most cases, it stops working after something as 30 minutes and requires also 30 minutes to wokr again. So it still requires a lot of work. Default disabled.

**NOTE:** Using GPS/GNSS without assistance data requires to place the `Thingy:91` with free sight to the sky to start. Once the first statelites are detected and the UTC time is available, the `Thingy:91` is able to optimize the GNSS receiving and continues to work also with less signal strength. In my experience, the very best results are achieved, when the GPS/GNSS is mostly on. That requires unfortunately 50mA and so works only for about 20h without charging. 

### Sensors

- **ADP536X_POWER_MANAGEMENT**, enable Thingy's battery power management. Reports battery status (e.g. charging) and level (e.g. 70%). Default enabled.

- **ADXL362_MOTION_DETECTION**, use ADXL362 to detect, if the Thingy:91 is moved. Only rudimentary function. Default disabled.

- **ADXL362_MOTION_DETECTION_LED**, use green LED to signal detected move. Default disabled.

### Environment Sensors

- **TEMPERATURE_OFFSET**, self-heating temperature offset. Default depends on selected sensor. Supported for `BME680` and `SHT3xD`.  

#### BME680

The `Thingy:91` is equiped with an environment sensor [BME680 (Bosch)](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/gas-sensors/bme680/). This sensor is mounted on the backside of the board towards the battery.

**NOTE:** During charging, the battery reaches easily 30Â° and the reported temperature reflects more this internal temperature than the environment. The enclosure of the `Thingy:91` seems also to decouple the sensor inside from the environment. Therefore either removing the board from the enclosure or using an external sensor may provide better values.

For the [BME680 (Bosch)](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/gas-sensors/bme680/) two drivers are available:

- **zephyr bme680 driver**, access to temperature, humidity, pressure, and the "gas sensor resistance". No additional source are required. Enabled at `Zephyr Kernel > Device Drivers > Sensor Drivers > BME680 sensor` (since NCS 2.1.0 already enabled by the device tree).

- **Bosch bme680 BSEC library** (Bosch Sensortec Environmental Cluster (BSEC 1.x)), access to temperature, humidity, pressure, and the IAQ (Index Air Quality).
The [BSEC library, v1.4.9.2](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/software-tools/software/bsec/) must be downloaded from this Bosch Website and comes with its own [license](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/bsec/2017-07-17_clickthrough_license_terms_environmentalib_sw_clean.pdf). Unzip the downloaded archive into the `zephyr-coaps-client/nrf/ext/` (or `<ncs>/nrf/ext/`). The resulting path must be `nrf/ext/bsec_1-4-9-2_generic_release`. The [BME68x-Sensor-API](https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BME68x-Sensor-API) is also required and could be [downloaded from github](https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BME68x-Sensor-API/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). Unzip this as well and copy the files `bme68x.c`, `bme68x.h`, and `bme68x_defs.h` additionally into the folder `nrf/ext/bsec_1-4-9-2_generic_release/examples`. If the preparation is done, disable `Zephyr Kernel > Device Drivers > Sensor Drivers > BME680 sensor` (if enabled), and then enable `Extra Functions > BME680 BSEC` instead.

**Note:** the usage of the IAQ (Index Air Quality) requires a calibration. See "BST-BME680-Integration-Guide-AN008-49.pdf":

"The IAQ accuracy indicator will notify the user when she/he should initiate a calibration process. Calibration is performed in the background if the sensor is exposed to clean or polluted air for approximately 30 minutes each."

(The calibration configuration is not stored for now.)

#### SHT3xD

Zephyr comes also with a driver for the [SHT3xD](https://sensirion.com/de/produkte/katalog/SHT31-DIS-B/) as external sensor.

- **zephyr SHT3XD driver**, access to temperature, humidity. No additional source are required. Requires a device-tree overlay, see [sht3x.overlay](../sht3x.overlay). Enabled at `Zephyr Kernel > Device Drivers > Sensor Drivers > SHT3xD`. (since NCS 2.1.0 already enabled by the overlay).
